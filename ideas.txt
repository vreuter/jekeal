Include bit about construction (de novo) DNMT3A/B vs. maintenance crew DNMT1.
Emphasize the role of 5mC derivatives like 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC as demethylation intermediates.
Essentially, the TET family performs the conversion to a derivative, allowing the DNA repair machinery to work.
With AID (activation-induced deamination) or APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like), conversion is directly to thymine or 5hmC.
Base excision and repair machinery can operate on 5caC, 5fC, 5hmU, or thymine to restore cytosine, but unmethylated.

PCB ASD:
  - Interaction between epigenetic modifications themselves
    - Negative association here between histone variant (H2A.Z) and methylation
        - Regions of DNA hypomethylation enriched for histone variant H2A.Z
    - Can assess this sort of interaction with a combination of experimental and analytical tools
      - ChIP-Seq
      - WGBS
  - Interaction with the environment (PCB's produce epigenetic changes)
  - Connection with LOOPER
    - Simplifies process of running analysis for multiple protocols
    - Protocol mapping
    - Library annotation in sample sheet

PCB-in-ASD paper focuses on methylation at more of a global/regional scale, does little with regard to epialleles.
  - Epipolymorphism
  - Delta combinatorial entropy
  - Extensions to other than group-of-four
