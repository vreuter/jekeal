# jekyll-reveal-starter-kit

A starting point for developing slide sets using the reveal.js
library and the jekyll static site generator.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a
[static-site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system#Static_page_generators)
typically used to generate blogs, but also used heavily by
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish websites.

This starter kit allows the user to create a
[RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) slide set for a class. This
particular version of reveal has
[been customized](https://github.com/Cara-Jo/reveal.js) specifically
by and for Girl Develop It to keep class materials consistent.

The [GDIMpls Version](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/reveal.js) of
reveal is embedded in this starter kit as a
[git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
in order to provide the ability to get central updates when the
designs change.

## Pre-requisites

This starter kit needs to have the following software already
installed:

* [Git](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/jekyll-reveal-starter-kit/wiki/Installing-Git)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/jekyll-reveal-starter-kit/wiki/Installing-Ruby)
* Ruby `bundler` gem:

``` bash
gem install bundler
```

* [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub#installation) if you are on a Mac



## Starter Kit Installation

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ "Forking a
    Repo on GitHub") the starter kit into your GitHub account

2. [Rename](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/
   "Renaming a GitHub repository")

3. In the repo's `Settings` area, set the "GitHub Pages" section to
   use "master branch /docs folder" if it isn't already set to that.

3. [Download or Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/
   "Clone a repository from GitHub")

3. `cd` into the local repo you just cloned

4. Run the `setup.sh` script

5. Modify the files `_staging.yml` and `_publish.yml` to fit your
   repo's needs.

## Configuration

There are some configuration values to set, which are found in the
`_config.yml`, `_staging.yml` and `_publish.yml` files in the home
directory. (See
[editing yaml files](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/jekyll-reveal-starter-kit/wiki/Editing-YAML-files)
in the starter kit wiki.) Edit these files in your code editor and
change the settings to be what you want.

*Note:* the `baseurl` value **must** begin with a "/" character. Leave
the end without a "/" character as well.

### `_config.yml`

Obvious things like the title, description, and keywords should be
changed to fit your new slide set. These appear in the head of the
documents, and in the default title page of the of the slide set.

Don't touch `baseurl` or `url` in this file. These are the values that
work with the Jekyll server so you can preview your work.

### `_staging.yml`

This file gets appended to the configuration set when building for
staging.  In this file, you should set the `url` field by changing the
`YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT` string to, well, your github account name.

Change `baseurl` to the name of your github repo. Make sure the string
begins with a forward slash ("/").

### `_publish.yml`

Change the `baseurl` to the name of the github repo as it will be on
`https://github.com/gdiminneapolis`. If you don't feel comfortable
doing this, discuss this with at the organization.

## Spin up the Jekyll Server

**NOTE** that the jekyll `--watch` option does **not** work on Windows. We have to do something else to make a convenient watching/viewing-as-you-save-changes thing.

Everything should be good to go, now, and you can start up the Jekyll
development server to show the slides while you create them.

    $ rake

You may want to pay attention to the terminal window running the
server, as that is where errors will be reported in case there's
something amiss in your slides. Every time you modify a file in
folder, jekyll will rebuild the site. Since there's not going to be a
lot of slides, or other material, this generally is very fast.

The server will show you the URL you can browse to locally to see the
slides. With this initial starter kit set up, there's no
live-reloading of changes, so you'll still need to refresh the slide
page in the browser.

## Creating the Slides

Slides live in the `_slides` folder, and should be named with the
following conventions:

* start with a sequence number, the slides will be ordered by this
  sequence number. A good sequencing scheme is `00.00` where the first
  set of numbers is the class section, and the second set is the
  slides in that section. Example: `00.00.introduction.html`
* the slide title, lowercased, only letters, numbers, and dashes --
  use dashes for spaces between words.
* the extension `.html` (you can also edit your slides in Markdown
  using the `.md` extension.)

For example, the introduction slide is:
`_slides/00.00.introduction.html` and the very last slide would be
`_slides/99.99.fin.html`.

A very good practice is to leave gaps in the sequence number to make
it easy to rearrange slides if you want, or insert content as you'd
like.

If you need more than 100 sections or more than 100 slides per
section, make sure your numbering allows this because the system is
rather stupid about it. Example: `000.001.slide-title.html`. If you do
think you need this, though, think about restructuring the
presentation into more than one slide set. You can create new
collections, for example, and have a root `.html` file for each
collection.

## Slide Content

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a preamble of YAML settings at the start of every slide.

Every slide needs to have at least the following frontmatter:

``` yaml
---
layout: slide
---
```

You can also put other meta data in the frontmatter. A useful one is the slide's title:

``` yaml
---
layout: slide
title: Let's Develop It!
---
```

And you can use the title in the body with a little Liquid:

``` html
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
```

This comes in very handy when there are multiple `section`s in the
slide to put the title on each `section`.


### Slide Body

After that point, you can provide the HTML that will make up your
slide.

In `reveal.js` whatever appears within a `<section>` tag is the body
of the slide. The `slide` layout in the frontmatter provides this for
you, so you can simply start on the content.

For example, the standard "Welcome" slide has the following content:

``` html
---
layout: slide
title: "Welcome!"
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="left-align">
  <p>Girl Develop It is here to provide affordable and accessible programs to learn software through mentorship and hands-on instruction.</p>
  <p class="green">Some "rules"</p>
  <ul class="go-wide">
    <li>We are here for you!</li>
    <li>Every question is important</li>
    <li>Help each other</li>
    <li>Have fun</li>
  </ul>
</div>

```

which should be pretty easy to figure out.

Note that slides can also be in MarkDown form. Use the `.md` or
`.markdown` extension instead of `.html`.

```markdown
---
layout: slide
title: "Welcome!"
---

# {{page.title}}

<div class="left-align">

Girl Develop It is here to provide affordable and accessible programs to learn software through mentorship and hands-on instruction.

Some "rules":
{:.green}

* We are here for you!
* Every question is important
* Help each other
* Have fun
{:.go-wide}

</div>
```


### Fragments

Using the class `.fragment` on an element will cause that element to
be loaded after the slide loads, like slide ups in powerpoint.

### Mulitple-page Slides

You can have slides roll up as well as over by making sub `<section>`
elements in the slide body.

This might make navigating confusing for some, however, since they
may not realize they have to press the down key instead of the right
key. If they using the space bar to navigate from slide to slide,
they'll get them in the right order.

### Code Snippets

Since we're all about the code, you can place code snippets on the slide using Jekyll's `highlight` feature:

``` html
Here's an example:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<div class="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>My Life</li>
  </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
```

Make sure to keep your snippets short, so they stay on the slide
nicely.

### Helper and Override Classes

There are several helper and override classes defined in `_sass/_overrides.scss`. Please feel free to add to this for your own work. You can add more Sass partials to the `_sass/` directory as well, just make sure they get `@import`ed in `css/main.scss`.

### JavaScripts

The `js/` directory holds the scripts you can change, or add your own. If you add new script files, make sure the add them in `_includes/scripts.html` as well. Follow the pattern used there for `revealConfig.js`.

## Build the Presentation

To build the slide presentation for publication, *stop* the running
`jekyll` server with `ctrl-C`. Then at the command line, enter:


    $ rake staging

or

    $ rake publish

This will build the presentation into the `docs` folder. You can open
the presentation from there to see if it's as you want.

## Publishing

With the new Github pages feature of serving from the master's `docs/`
folder, all the worry about setting up a special `gh-pages` branch and
tweaking the local build destination has gone away. After the above
build step, just add, commit, push the changes **including the `docs/`
folder** to the remote repo.

### Keep Git Up to Date

Like with any other project, use git's features to maintain a good
clean working tree and remote repository. When you want to start off
on a new feature, or just try something out, create a branch. If it's
what you want, merge it back in to master.
